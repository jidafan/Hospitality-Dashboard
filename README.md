## Introduction

In this project, we will use PowerBI to create a dashboard using data from AtliQ Grands Hotel data. We will create a dashboard that displays relevant KPIs that will help the company regain its market share and increase its revenue. The data is sourced from [Code Basics](https://codebasics.io/) 

## Data Review
